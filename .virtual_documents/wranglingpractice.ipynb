# In social science, every interesting problem is fundamentally a missing data issue.
# In Pandas, there are two options for representing missing values
# - the default is to treat it as an np.nan from the NumPy package ('not a number') and its type is a float
# - Pandas also treats a missing value as a None: an empty/null object without a type or value
